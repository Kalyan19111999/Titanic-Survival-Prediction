# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Predicting the survivors of titanic incident based on a made up dataset.

The dataset contains various attribues such as PassengerId, Name, Age, Pclass, Gender, Fare, TicketNo, Sibsp and Survived.
The attributes PassengerId, Name, Age, Gender, Subsp Fare, TicketNo, Pclass are treated as independent variables.
The attribute Survived is treated as a dependent variable which is to be predicted.

A machine learning classification model is built using this data for predictions.
A 'Kernel SVM' model is selected as the classification algorithm to be used.
'train.csv' file contains the training datam for the model and 'test.csv' data is used to predict the values based on it.
